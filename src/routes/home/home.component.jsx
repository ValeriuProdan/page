            Hello! I am a software engineer at Google, where I work on the
            YouTube ads team (a.k.a., "the guys flooding you with ads that you
            hate" - unless you have premium, in which case you are not
            contributing to my salary ðŸ˜ž).
          </p>
          <p>
            The point of this webpage is to have a playground for implementing
            stuff I learn from tutorials and create a way for people to get to
            know me. Here you can explore my work, see some of my photography,
            and learn about my professional journey.
